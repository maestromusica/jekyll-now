    <p>Modern programming languages abstract a lot of low-level details of how our code
works. Nonetheless, a good understanding of underlying computer science concepts
can help you write better code‚Ä¶ and pass technical interviews üòâ Let‚Äôs talk about two fundamental data structures everyone needs to know:
<strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>linked lists</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-are-arrays-and-linked-lists-lets-think-low-level">So what are arrays and linked lists? Let‚Äôs think low-level.</h3>

<p>An array is a collection of variables (or objects) that is stored in a memory as
a consecutive block of data.</p>

<figure class="class1 class2">
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*htdnGT1LBPpiRMuw4sRkPg.png" alt="" /></p>
  <figcaption>myArray in memory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When an array is declared, an appropriately sized block of memory is reserved.</p>

<p><strong>An array has a constant size.</strong> The memory ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù the array might be
already in use, so we can‚Äôt just make the array ‚Äúlonger‚Äù to store more elements.</p>

<p>Each element in the array has some index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> that tells us where the element is
in the array.</p>

<p>Element‚Äôs address (where it is located in the memory) can be easily computed. We
need the address of the beginning of the array (called <strong>base address</strong>), and an
index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> of that element:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">element_address = base_address + i * element_size</code></p>

<p>This is important, because it allows us to <strong>quickly access any element with a
known index.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <strong>array is just a block of memory containing a number of variables or objects</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All elements are stored in order, one after another.</p>

<p>On the contrary, in a <strong>linked list</strong> there is no particular order in which
list‚Äôs elements are located in memory: they might be non-consecutive and
out-of-order. This is because memory is allocated as we create elements, on
as-needed basis.</p>

<figure class="class1 class2">
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8ww-gpHZ-u7pJb1DTThWzw.png" alt="" /></p>
  <figcaption>Linked list in memory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In a (singly) linked list each element is represented by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the element itself</li>
  <li>a pointer <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_element</code> (represented by arrows on the illustration) to the next
element in the list</li>
</ul>

<p>We have to keep a pointer (usually called <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code>) to the first element in the
list. Often, we want to keep a pointer (usually called <code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code>) to the last
element in the list for fast access. To summarize:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Element contains:
   value - value/object we're storing
   next_element - pointer to the next element in the list

LinkedList contains:
   head - pointer to the first element in the list
   tail - pointer to the last element in the list
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dynamic-array"><strong>Dynamic array</strong></h3>

<h4 id="arrays-always-have-a-constant-size-what-can-we-do-if-you-want-to-add-another-element-to-an-already-full-array"><strong>Arrays always have a constant size. What can we do if you want to add another element to an already full array?</strong></h4>

<p>We can: 1) create a new, bigger array, 2) copy all elements from the old array
to it, 3) add the new element at the end.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">Dynamic arrays</a> use this approach.
To add a new element:</p>

<p>A) If there is space in the underlying array ‚Äî just add the element<br /> B) If
there is no more space for a new element ‚Äî create a new, bigger array (typically
<strong>twice the size</strong>), copy all elements from the old array, and add the new
element at the end (see illustration below).</p>

<figure class="class1 class2">
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gIsT4ryqzI3_gaMgFjte3A.png" alt="" /></p>
  <figcaption>Inserting elements into a dynamic array
(<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Dynamic_array.svg/289px-Dynamic_array.svg.png">source</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Size</strong> (or <strong>logical size</strong>) is the number of elements that are stored in our
data structure. <strong>Capacity</strong> is the maximum number of elements that could fit in
the underlying array. For example, on the illustration below, initial capacity
of the array is 2 and its size is 1.</p>

<p><strong>Are those‚Ä¶ turtles?</strong>üò±</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Notice that sometimes inserting a new element happens very fast (case A), but
sometimes we need to <strong>copy an entire array</strong> (case B). Thus, occasionally an
insertion will take longer (as indicated by those adorable turtles).</p>

<p>How much longer? That depends on the number of elements in the array ‚Äî copying
an array takes linear time.</p>

<p><strong>That‚Äôs quite sluggish, isn‚Äôt?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yeah, dynamic arrays are not <em>always</em> fast. But those slow insertions are
not happening that often‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2011sp/Lectures/lec20-amortized/amortized.htm">proved</a> that <strong>inserting an element into a dynamic array takes, on average, constant time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="wait-how-can-this-be-true">Wait, how can this be true?</h4>

<p>A ‚Äúproper‚Äù proof is beyond the scope of this article, but I‚Äôll try to give you an intuitive explanation.</p>

<p>When doubling the size of the array, we have to copy some number of elements (let‚Äôs call that number <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>).</p>

<p>Newly allocated, bigger array will have <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> ‚Äúfree spots‚Äù, so next <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> insertions will be fast.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúcost‚Äù of copying the array is proportional to <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>, but it is ‚Äúamortized‚Äù over <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> insertions. Thus, average cost ‚Äúper insertion‚Äù is constant.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre still confused (or curious), you might want to watch this excellent video on Coursera:</p>

<h4 id="hey-but-what-about-this-extra-memory-we-reserved-what-happens-when-we-remove-elements">Hey, but what about this extra memory we reserved? What happens when we remove elements?</h4>

<p>Good question. Imagine a full dynamic array with a capacity of 10 000 elements. Now, let‚Äôs suppose we remove 9 000 elements.</p>

<p>If we don‚Äôt resize the underlying array, our data structure will only use 10% of the allocated space. That‚Äôs not good.</p>

<p>Just as we increased the capacity of the array when adding elements, we should reduce the capacity when removing elements.</p>

<p>Typically, when the size of a dynamic array drops below a certain percentage of it‚Äôs capacity, we move all elements to a new, smaller array.</p>

<p>Like when adding elements, just the other way around!</p>

<h4 id="but-i-always-just-added-and-removed-elements-without-think-about-any-of-those-things">But I always just added and removed elements without think about any of those things!</h4>

<p>Many high-level programing languages provide functionality of dynamic arrays ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù. JavaScript engines do
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jscript/2008/03/26/performance-optimization-of-arrays-part-i/">magic</a> that allows programmer to add and remove elements from the array as he pleases. In Python, lists are implemented using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#how-are-lists-implemented">dynamic arrays with some extra cleverness
added</a>.</p>

<p>Abstracting such details allows you to focus on solving the problem at hand and makes developing software easier.</p>

<hr />

<p>We talked about 3 fundamental data structures: arrays, lists and dynamic arrays.
But we barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>In the next part we will compare those data structures. We will investigate
operations supported by them, and their time complexity.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
