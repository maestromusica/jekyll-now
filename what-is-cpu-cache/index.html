    <p>Modern programming languages abstract a lot of low-level details of how our code
works. Nonetheless, a good understanding of underlying computer science concepts
can help you write better code… and pass technical interviews 😉 Let’s talk about
what is a CPU cache and why it’s important.</p>

<p>During my computer science degree, I learned about basic building blocks of
electronic circuits, and how they can be used to build logic gates. Those logic
gates provide a <strong>layer of abstraction</strong> that allows engineers to reason in
terms of logic operations, and not electrical currents and voltages.</p>

<p>Logic gates  can be combined  to build a computer that provides us with another
layer of abstraction. It allows a programmer to think in terms of a set of
available CPU instructions and not just logic gates.</p>

<p>Languages like Python allow programmers to think in terms of high level concepts
and not just basic operations the CPU supports — that’s yet another layer of
abstraction.</p>

<p>In computer science, more than in any other field, we have many layers of
abstraction that enable us to solve problems faster, without worrying about the
underlying implementation.</p>

<p>But there is no such thing as a perfect abstraction. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">All abstraction
leak</a>
at one point or another,  and we suddenly have to deal with the underlying
complexity.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons programming is so fun… and frustrating. Concepts and
ideas interweave, sometimes making debugging very challenging — but also very
rewarding.</p>

  <figcaption>An array (top) vs a linked list (bottom) — note how elements of a list are
scattered around the memory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s look at an example — a high level problem. Let’s say you have to decide
between using <a href="https://medium.com/@lukdomanski/interview-preparations-everything-you-need-to-know-about-lists-and-arrays-81093c140e78">a linked list and an
array</a>.
The main requirement is that iterating through elements has to be as fast as
possible. What do you think — which data structure will be faster?</p>

<p>The time it takes to iterate through all elements is <strong>proportional to the
number of elements</strong> — the bigger the list/array, the longer it will take to
visit all elements. Quite intuitive, right?</p>

<p>From a high-level point of view, it should not matter if you chose to use an
array or a list. Both data structures should take more or less the same amount
of time.</p>

<p>You might be surprised to learn that an array can be <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36939141/why-use-lists-when-arrays-are-faster">significantly
faster</a>
than a linked list.</p>

<h4 id="but-whyyyyyyyyy">But whyyyyyyyyy</h4>

<p>To understand why, we have to go down many levels of abstraction — we have to
investigate how the hardware you’re using works. First, we need to understand
what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache">CPU cache</a> is.</p>

<p>Modern processors are very fast in comparison to how much time it takes to
access main memory. To reduce the time it takes to access RAM, data that is most
likely to be needed by the CPU is placed in a memory that’s smaller, faster, and
located “closer” to the processor. We call that memory <strong>CPU cache.</strong></p>

<p>Imagine working in a grocery store that is getting its supplies from a big
warehouse. The warehouse can store a lot of stuff but it takes a while to find
and access things kept there.</p>

<p>That’s why every grocery store has a certain supply of all products (those most
likely to be purchased by customers) stored on its premises. You can’t store
that many things in the store, but they are  quickly accessible.</p>

<p>This is exactly how a CPU cache works.</p>

<figure class="class1 class2">
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*jwPBgH1VX05BHhN8vrQBxg.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
  <figcaption>Main memory is like a warehouse — it can store a lot of stuff but it takes a
while to access it</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="you-might-be-asking-how-do-we-know-what-data-should-be-stored-in-cache">You might be asking: how do we know what data should be stored in cache?</h4>

<p>A computer program is basically just a sequence of instructions to be executed
by the CPU. Those instructions are often accessed in order, one after another.</p>

<p>The same is true for arrays — we often iterate through them, accessing all
elements in order, one after another. If we’re accessing an element with an
index 5, it’s also likely we are interested in elements 6 and 7.</p>

<p>That’s why memory addresses that are “close” to a recently accessed address are
more likely to be visited again. <strong>When accessing some memory, “nearby” segments
of memory should be place in cache as well.</strong></p>

<h4 id="okay-that-is-interesting-but-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-our-data-structures">Okay, that is interesting. But what does it have to do with our data structures?</h4>

<p>Let’s supposed that a CPU needs to access some memory address. First, it will
check if it’s available in the cache. If it is, then it can be accessed very
quickly.</p>

<p>However, if it’s not currently stored in the cache, we have to fetch it from the
main memory. We call that a <strong>cache miss</strong>. Cache misses slow down the execution
of our code because accessing the main memory is relatively slow.</p>

<p>Since all elements in the array are stored as a continuous block of memory, when
reading an element with some index <code class="highlighter-rouge">k</code>, following elements (<code class="highlighter-rouge">k+1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">k+2</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">k+3</code>,…) will be cached as well.</p>

<p><strong>This leads to fewer cache misses</strong> and results in better performance compared
to a linked list, as in a linked list elements might be scattered around the
memory.</p>

<hr />

<p>To answer a seemingly simple question we had to dive really deep. We had to
understand what a CPU cache is and how it works.</p>

<p>I think we can all agree — programming never gets boring 😀</p>
