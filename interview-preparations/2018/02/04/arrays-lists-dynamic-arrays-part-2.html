    <p>Modern programming languages abstract a lot of low-level details of how our code
works. Nonetheless, a good understanding of underlying computer science concepts
can help you write better code‚Ä¶ and pass technical interviews üòâ In the previous part
of this article we introduced arrays, lists, and dynamic arrays. Now, we will look into
the operations they support and how fast those operations are.</p>

<figure class="class1 class2">

<p>In the first part of the article we introduced three fundamental data
structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>an array</strong> ‚Äî a collection of elements stored in the memory as a single,
continuous block of data</li>
  <li><strong>a list</strong> ‚Äî a collection of elements, each containing a link to the next
element</li>
  <li><strong>a dynamic array</strong> ‚Äî an array that is resized to fit all elements without
wasting too much space</li>
</ul>

<p>Let‚Äôs compare those data structures. What operations do they support? How fast
are they?</p>

<p>A basic understanding of time complexity and big-O notation is required as I use
them extensively. If you‚Äôre not familiar with those concepts, HackerRank has a
great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw">video-explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dig in!</p>

<h3 id="what-operations-are-supported-by-those-data-structures-what-is-their-time-complexity">What operations are supported by those data structures? What is their time complexity?</h3>

<p><em>(In this section I denote the size of the array as <strong>n</strong>)</em></p>

<h4 id="array">Array</h4>

<p>‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù arrays are dead simple. We can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>access an element given its index</strong> ‚Äî in <strong>O(1)</strong> time. We know exactly where
each element is located in memory, so we can access it very quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>That‚Äôs all. We can‚Äôt add or remove new elements (arrays always have a constant
size).</p>

<h4 id="dynamic-array">Dynamic array</h4>

<p>Dynamic arrays are more interesting. As with ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù arrays, given an index,
we can <strong>access a corresponding element in constant time</strong>. Dynamic arrays also
support adding and removing elements.</p>

<p><strong>Adding an element</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>at the end of the list</strong> ‚Äî takes, on average, <strong>O(1)</strong> time. Remember that
some insertions will take <strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
  <li><strong>at the beginning of the list, or somewhere in the middle</strong> ‚Äî takes linear
time. To insert a new element in the middle of the list, we have to ‚Äúshift‚Äù all
preceding elements by one position (see illustration below). We have to copy a
portion of the array ‚Äî <strong>O(n)</strong> elements, so this operation takes <strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Removing an element</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>from the end of the list</strong> ‚Äî takes, on average, <strong>O(1)</strong> time. Again, some
insertions are slow and take linear time.</li>
  <li><strong>from somewhere else in the list</strong> ‚Äî takes <strong>O(n)</strong> time. As with adding an
element in the middle, we have to shift all preceding elements ‚Äî this time in
the opposite direction (see illustration below). Thus, removal will take
<strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="linked-list">Linked List</h4>

<p>In a linked list, accessing an element with a given index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> is a bit more
complicated. As we don‚Äôt know where that element can be found in memory, we have
to iterate through the list until we find it. This will take <strong>O(n)</strong> time.
That‚Äôs significantly slower than other data structures we discussed.</p>

<p>Lists allow adding and removing elements too.</p>

<p><strong>Adding an element</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>at the beginning of the list</strong> - is just a matter of changing a few pointers, so it can be done in <strong>O(1)</strong> time. We have to change the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> so that it points to our new element <code class="highlighter-rouge">NEW</code> and set <code class="highlighter-rouge">NEW.next_element</code> so that it points to <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> (see illustration below).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>somewhere in the middle</strong> ‚Äî can always be done in <strong>O(n)</strong> time. First, we need to find the spot where we want to insert the element ‚Äî this will take <strong>O(n)</strong>. Inserting the element can be done in <strong>O(1)</strong> time, so the whole operation takes <strong>O(n)</strong> + <strong>O(1)</strong> = <strong>O(n)</strong> time.</li>
  <li><strong>at the end of the list</strong> ‚Äî if we keep a reference to the last object, we can do this in <strong>O(1)</strong> time! Otherwise, we have to iterate through the entire array to find the last element. This will take <strong>O(n)</strong> time. Implementations of a link list typically include that reference to the last object to keep this operations quick.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Removing an element</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>from the beginning</strong> ‚Äî takes <strong>O(1)</strong>. As with adding the element at the beginning of the list, we only need to change a few pointers.</li>
  <li><strong>from anywhere else in the list</strong> ‚Äî takes <strong>O(n)</strong> time. We have to find the element first (which will take <strong>O(n)</strong> time) and remove it. To remove the element <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> we change the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">B.next_element</code> so that it points to <code class="highlighter-rouge">D</code>. That‚Äôs it.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>That‚Äôs it! You know quite a lot about arrays and lists now. You should probably practice some <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/">interview questions</a>!</p>

<p>In the third (and last) part, we‚Äôll investigate why arrays can be significantly faster than linked lists when iterate through elements.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
