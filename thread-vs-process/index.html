    <p>Modern programming languages abstract a lot of low-level details of how our code
works. Nonetheless, a good understanding of underlying computer science concepts
can help you write better code‚Ä¶ and pass technical interviews üòâ Let‚Äôs talk about a popular interview question: <em>‚ÄúWhat are the differences between a process and a thread?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>I will assume that you have a basic understanding of how a processor works, and
how data is stored in memory. In particular, you should be familiar with <strong>CPU
registers</strong>, <a href="https://www.gribblelab.org/CBootCamp/7_Memory_Stack_vs_Heap.html">stack, and
heap</a>.</p>

<p>Before we try to make any comparisons, we need to get a solid grasp of relevant
terminology.</p>

<p>First, we need to understand what a <strong>computer program</strong> is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A computer program is a set of instructions that can be executed by the CPU</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A program is a static entity: it might be an executable file located somewhere
in the file system. When you double-click the icon or run a command in the
terminal, the program is loaded into RAM, and then it becomes a <strong>process</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>process</strong> is a program in execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you run a program multiple times there will be a few processes running
simultaneously, all corresponding to the same program.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need processes?</strong></p>

<p>Each process contains everything required to run (or restart) the program:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Address space</strong> ‚Äî an abstraction for all memory available to that process.
Address space contains program‚Äôs code and data required to run the program
(static data, heap, and stack).</li>
  <li>One or more <strong>threads of execution</strong> (I‚Äôll explain that term in detail later)</li>
  <li>Set of <strong>OS resources</strong>, for example opened files or network connections</li>
</ul>

<figure class="class1 class2">
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*30_qL_hReOgXKmMU.jpg" alt="" /></p>
  <figcaption><em>A photo of a thread. I‚Äôm very funny.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each process contains a single or multiple <strong>threads of execution</strong>. If a
process has a single thread, only one action can be performed at a time. If a
process has multiple threads, it can perform multiple actions at the same time.</p>

<p>A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently from
other code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Thread (or a thread of execution) is a sequence of instructions that can be
processed by a single CPU core.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine that you are planning a programming conference: you should create a plan
of the event: who will be giving talks, what will they be about, and so on
(that‚Äôs our <strong>program</strong>). The big day comes, guests arrive and our event is
taking place (our <strong>process</strong>). During the conference, many talks (<strong>threads</strong>)
might happen at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="threads"><strong>Threads</strong></h4>

<p>Each thread contains all information necessary to execute it‚Äôs code. We need to
keep track of 1) which part of the program is currently being executed and 2)
what is currently stored in memory.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why each thread has its own <strong>program counter</strong> (a pointer that indicates
which instruction will be executed next), <strong>CPU registers</strong>, and a <strong>stack</strong>.</p>

<p>Threads within the same process share all other memory segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>heap</strong> ‚Äî containing dynamically allocated variables</li>
  <li><strong>text segment</strong> ‚Äî containing program‚Äôs code</li>
  <li><strong>data segment</strong> ‚Äî containing global or static variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Other system resources such as currently opened files are shared as well. If a
file is opened, all threads can use it.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, but we didn‚Äôt really answer the question ‚Äî what are the differences
between a thread and a process?</strong></p>

<p>The most significant, practical difference is in how processes and threads
communicate.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, <strong>threads share memory</strong>. Thus, many threads can
access and modify the same memory, which may lead to bugs that are very
difficult to find.</p>

<p>Processes don‚Äôt share memory in this way, they have to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">inter-process
communication</a>
instead.</p>

<p>Creating a process is fairly resource-intensive. It is generally more efficient
to use a single multi-threaded process than to spawn multiple single-threaded
processes.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>process</strong> is a program in execution. A <strong>thread</strong> is a sequence of program‚Äôs
instructions that can be executed by a single CPU.</li>
  <li>A process might contain many threads. Those threads will share most of memory
segments. <strong>Threads may access and modify shared memory.</strong> Processes use
<em>inter-process communication</em> instead.</li>
</ul>
